Sword Demo
=================

Basic Sword Game with multiplayer, written in high school. Uses Irrlicht 1.7.2, Irrklang 1.3, Newton Game Dynamics 2.36 and Raknet 4.051 as libraries.
Most of the libraries and code are obselete, but a valuable learning experience nonetheless. Controls use the mouse to manually control the positioning and combat with a sword.

Building
=================
You should first build RakNet, then drop the rest of the the libraries in your C Drive. Then you can compile with Visual Studio, although it was built with 2010 C++ edition.
